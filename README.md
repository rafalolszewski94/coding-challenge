Implement following view:

- when user lands on application page, on the left side of the screen he/she should see list of all book titles (and only titles) ordered ascending
- at the same time, on the right side of the screen, user should see view that displays details of selected book.
- When no book is selected, book details view should display default message ("select book").
- whenever user clicks on book title on the list, details of selected book should appear in details view
  Technical requirements:

- book list and book details should be two separate components, then should not be nested in each other
- it should use promises
- list of all books and book details components can both be visible on screen for whole time (no need for navigation)
